# GitLab (Linux package image, Docker or a fakeroot Apptainer instance) behind an endpoint, with CI runners

What building `workflows/gitlab` taught (2026-10-28/29, GitLab 19.5.1-ee, gitlab-runner
19.5.1, Jacamar CI 0.31.0; Docker through `sudo` on a lab node, gcpsmall and awsstig,
apptainer 1.5.5 on gcpsmall, singularity-ce 4.5.1 on awsstig's STIG image). The endpoint mechanics are [../activate-platform.md](../activate-platform.md)
§10, the OIDC recipe [../oidc-sign-in.md](../oidc-sign-in.md); this file is what GitLab
adds to them. The two runtimes share `lib/` (controller checks and runner tools, the
start template's first half, the launcher's GitLab logic); each runtime's files only
start and stop the container and define `gitlab_exec`, `gitlab_alive` and `gitlab_logs`.

## Running it

- **The image needs root, not necessarily Docker.** The Linux package (`gitlab/gitlab-ee`,
  `gitlab/gitlab-ce`) runs as root with runit as PID 1 and its services as eight accounts
  (`git` 998, `gitlab-www`, `gitlab-psql`, ...), bundling Puma, Sidekiq, Gitaly,
  PostgreSQL, Redis and nginx; the image is 4.7 GB, the SIF 1.8 GB. Two runtimes:
  - **Docker** (`gitlab-docker/`): the `openproject-docker` pattern (`docker run -d` in a
    launcher under `pw endpoints run`, `docker logs -f & wait` as the foreground,
    `cancel.sh` with `docker rm -f`, `flock` on the run directory; on a FIPS-mode host
    `-v <file holding 0>:/proc/sys/crypto/fips_enabled:ro`, see the Singularity bullet).
    A cold start answered `/users/sign_in` in about 2.5 minutes on a 20-core node; later
    starts take about 2.
  - **Singularity** (`gitlab-singularity/`, SIF `ghcr.io/parallelworks/gitlab:19.5.1-ee`
    built from `gitlab.def`, the image unchanged): the controller pulls the SIF once into
    the install directory; the start template probes whether this node mounts it under
    fakeroot with a writable layer and either runs the SIF as is (`--writable-tmpfs`) or
    extracts it once per run directory (`singularity build --fakeroot --sandbox
    <rundir>/image <sif>`, 45 s, a marker names the SIF it came from so a new tag replaces
    it) and runs the directory with `--writable`; then an Apptainer **instance** with
    `--fakeroot <that flag> --contain --cleanenv --uts --hostname <host> --workdir
    <rundir>/work`, the three volumes bound from the run directory, the snippet directory
    as `/etc/gitlab/activate` and a copy of `/assets/sshd_config` with the form's port
    (`ListenAddress 127.0.0.1`) over the image's; on a FIPS-mode host also a file holding
    `0` over `/proc/sys/crypto/fips_enabled`; then `exec --cleanenv --pwd / instance://<name>
    /assets/init-container` (the image's entrypoint; `/assets/gitlab.rb` already sets
    `manage_accounts['enable'] = false` and `package['modify_kernel_parameters'] = false`)
    in the launcher's foreground. `work/tmp` (`chmod 1777`) is the container's `/tmp`
    through `--workdir` and singularity's own `TMPDIR`. The container shares the host's
    network, so `nginx['listen_port'] = $PORT` with `nginx['listen_addresses'] =
    ['127.0.0.1']`, and the package's other fixed loopback listeners (which Docker
    isolates per container) are moved or turned off so two GitLabs can share a node:
    `puma['port']` (workhorse uses puma's unix socket),
    `gitlab_workhorse['prometheus_listen_addr']` and `gitaly['configuration'] =
    { prometheus_listen_addr: ... }` to free ports, `sidekiq['metrics_enabled']`,
    `sidekiq['health_checks_enabled']`, `nginx['status']['enable']` (port 8060 on every
    interface) and `gitlab_kas['enable']` to false; verified with `ss -ltn` on the host:
    PostgreSQL and Redis listen on unix sockets only. `GITLAB_OMNIBUS_CONFIG` goes in as
    `APPTAINERENV_`/`SINGULARITYENV_` with `$`, backticks and backslashes escaped;
    `GITLAB_SKIP_TAIL_LOGS=true` keeps the package's logs in `logs/` instead of the job
    output. `gitlab_exec` is `exec instance://<name>`. Why the sandbox fallback: the STIG
    image of awsstig (singularity-ce 4.5.1, `/tmp` noexec, fusermount3 without
    `user_allow_other`, `mount` not executable from a user namespace, FIPS mode) can
    neither mount the SIF nor overlay it; gcpsmall (apptainer 1.5.5) runs the SIF as is.
    Details and conditions: pitfalls, "A root-only image runs under Apptainer as a
    `--fakeroot` instance; the SIF where the node mounts it, an extracted sandbox where it
    does not" (a subuid range for the user, a local filesystem, the 1777 `/tmp`, the FIPS
    bind, `gitlab-ctl stop` through `exec instance://` in `cancel.sh`).
  - **State on a network filesystem = an ext3 image** (2026-10-29, after the first HSP
    launch on barfoot's Lustre home failed with `Errno::EPERM @ apply2files
    /var/opt/gitlab/.gitconfig`): the template probes a `chown 998` in `data/` through
    the container; on failure three sparse ext3 images under `state/` (`apptainer
    overlay create`; `config.img`, `logs.img`, `data.img`) are bound in place of the
    three directories (`--bind state/data.img:/var/opt/gitlab:image-src=/upper`), the
    rootfs keeps `--writable-tmpfs` (a single `--overlay` image broke runit: pitfalls),
    the host-side files (runner/, .root_password, markers) stay as they are, and
    `lib/start.sh` treats an existing `state/data.img` as "database exists". Hidden inputs
    `service.state_layout` (auto|directories|image) and `service.state_image_size` (GB)
    force it for tests (`tests/general/gcpsmall-image.json`).
  - **Login node only, both runtimes** (2026-10-29): the YAMLs have no scheduler section
    and call the submitter with `scheduler: false`. A service that outlives the run has
    no place in an allocation, and on the cloud clusters a compute node has no subuid
    range and mounts home over NFS, where the namespace's `chown` is refused (the start
    template still checks both and says so). The CI jobs are what reach the compute
    nodes.
- **Configuration in one env line.** `GITLAB_OMNIBUS_CONFIG` is Ruby evaluated after
  `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` at every start; a docker `--env-file` takes no newlines, so
  join the statements with `; `. It must contain `external_url 'https://<host>'`,
  `nginx['listen_port'] = 80`, `nginx['listen_https'] = false` and
  `letsencrypt['enable'] = false`, or the bundled nginx wants certificates. The config
  volume (`/etc/gitlab`) is written as root, so anything the host's user must rewrite
  on every start (the nginx snippet below) is a separate bind mount of a file in the
  run's own job dir, not a file in that volume.
- **Memory.** `prometheus_monitoring['enable'] = false`, `puma['worker_processes'] = 2`
  and `sidekiq['concurrency'] = 10` keep a demo instance around 3 GB; the docs' floor is
  4 GB RAM for real use, 8 GB recommended.
- **Probe `/users/sign_in` with the public `Host`** from inside the node: it answers 200
  only once Puma serves *and* the forwarded-protocol fix works (302 to itself
  otherwise); `/-/readiness` says nothing about the latter.

## The session proxy and the sign-in (both verified)

- **Forwarded headers.** The platform proxy sends `X-Forwarded-Proto: http`; GitLab
  with an https `external_url` then redirects every page to itself and drops its
  Secure session cookie. The bundled nginx fixes it on its own, no extra proxy:
  `nginx['proxy_set_headers'] = { 'Host' => '$http_host_with_default', 'X-Real-IP' =>
  '$remote_addr', 'X-Forwarded-For' => '$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for',
  'X-Forwarded-Proto' => 'https', 'X-Forwarded-Ssl' => 'on', 'Upgrade' =>
  '$http_upgrade', 'Connection' => '$connection_upgrade' }`.
- **The hop to the identity provider.** The proxy rewrites a redirect to another host
  onto the session's host, so the `302` that `POST /users/auth/openid_connect` answers
  (to `https://<platform>/api/oidc/authorize?...`) must become a 200 hop page. The
  bundled nginx can do it for that one route: `nginx['custom_gitlab_server_config'] =
  'include /etc/gitlab/activate/nginx.conf;'` is inserted at the end of the server
  block (rendered at `data/nginx/conf/service_conf/gitlab-rails.conf`), and the
  included file defines `location = /users/auth/openid_connect { proxy_pass
  http://gitlab-workhorse; <the proxy_set_header lines above>; proxy_intercept_errors
  on; error_page 301 302 303 307 308 = @activate_hop; }` plus the `@activate_hop`
  named location from the OpenProject recipe (`return 200 '<meta http-equiv="refresh"
  ...$upstream_http_location>'`, same-host targets re-issued as `302`, the upstream's
  `Set-Cookie` re-added). `gitlab-workhorse` is the upstream's name and
  `$http_host_with_default` is set in the server block, so both are available to the
  snippet. Verified with the curl flow of oidc-sign-in.md: the POST came back 200 with
  the authorize URL carrying `client_id`, `code_challenge_method=S256` and the
  registered `redirect_uri`.
- **The provider.** `gitlab_rails['omniauth_providers'] = [{ name: 'openid_connect',
  label: 'ACTIVATE', args: { name: 'openid_connect', scope: ['openid', 'profile',
  'email'], response_type: 'code', issuer: 'https://<platform>/api/oidc', discovery:
  false, uid_field: 'preferred_username', pkce: true, client_options: { identifier,
  secret, redirect_uri: 'https://<host>/users/auth/openid_connect/callback',
  authorization_endpoint, token_endpoint, userinfo_endpoint, jwks_uri:
  'https://<platform>/api/platform/keys', end_session_endpoint } } }]`, with
  `omniauth_allow_single_sign_on = ['openid_connect']`, `omniauth_auto_link_user =
  ['openid_connect']` and `omniauth_block_auto_created_users` as the form says. The
  callback path is fixed by GitLab, so the application is registered for exactly
  `https://<subdomain>.<sessions domain>/users/auth/openid_connect/callback`. OIDC
  sign-in is in the Free tier; no license needed.
- **git cannot clone through the endpoint**: the proxy demands the platform's login or
  bearer key and strips `Authorization` before GitLab sees it. Clones go to the
  container's published loopback ports instead (`-p 127.0.0.1:${PORT}:80`,
  `-p 127.0.0.1:<ssh port>:22`): from the cluster `http://localhost:<port>`, from a
  laptop through `pw forward -L`. `gitlab_rails['gitlab_shell_ssh_port']` puts the
  SSH port into the clone URLs GitLab shows.

## Automating the first start (verified)

- **A root API token without a password**: `docker exec <c> gitlab-rails runner "t =
  User.find_by_username('root').personal_access_tokens.create!(scopes: ['api',
  'create_runner'], name: '...', expires_at: 1.day.from_now); puts t.token"` prints a
  usable token in about 40 s (Rails boot); `DELETE /api/v4/personal_access_tokens/self`
  revokes it (204). `gitlab_rails['initial_root_password']` applies only when the
  database is created; a user-readable sign that it exists is `data/postgresql/data`
  (`data/postgresql` is `2775`).
- **Runners through the API**: `POST /api/v4/user/runners` with `runner_type=
  instance_type`, `tag_list`, `run_untagged` returns the `glrt-` token (201); keep it
  (`POST /api/v4/runners/verify` with `token` says 200 while it is valid) and rewrite
  `config.toml` on every start because the GitLab port changes with the endpoint. Set
  `url` **and** `clone_url` to `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`: the job payload otherwise
  tells the runner to clone from `external_url`, which the proxy blocks. The runner
  runs as the user (`gitlab-runner run --config ... --working-directory ...`, "Running
  in user-mode" is fine) under `setsid`, outside the endpoint's process tree, and
  `cancel.sh` kills its session. A `POST /projects/:id/repository/commits` with
  `.gitlab-ci.yml` starts the first pipeline at once.
- **A success body can carry a secret** (the runner token): print `message` from an
  error body, never the body of a call that may have succeeded.
- **The run must not complete before this setup is done.** The platform's probe of
  `/users/sign_in` would see 200 as soon as Puma serves, so the nginx snippet gates
  that one route (503 until the launcher touches `ready`, bypassed by the launcher's
  own `X-Activate-Probe` header); the general entry is in pitfalls.md ("Setup that
  must run after the service answers gates the probed route"). The gate directory is
  `chmod 755`: nginx's workers test the marker as an unprivileged user.
- **Two GitLabs on one host** (a kept demo instance beside a test) need distinct run
  directories, subdomains and SSH ports; the container carries
  `--label activate.rundir=<run directory>` so a test's leftover check counts only its
  own (`docker ps -aq --filter label=activate.rundir=$HOME/<dir>`).

## Jacamar CI (the SLURM runner)

- Prebuilt static binaries live in gitlab.com's **generic package registry**, not in
  the release assets: `https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/ecp-ci%2Fjacamar-ci/
  packages/generic/jacamar-ci/<ver>/jacamar-ci-<ver>.ubi9.amd64.tar.gz` holds
  `jacamar` and `jacamar-auth` at its root (`checksums.sha256.txt` beside it; the
  controller pins the tarball's sha256). The RPMs there need root to install; a Go
  build from source also works (`make build` with Go 1.20+, `libseccomp` headers).
- **Plain `jacamar` refuses to run without `--no-auth`** ("Jacamar requires --no-auth
  in order to support execution requirements", the job fails in `prepare_executor`):
  every stage's args start with it, `["--no-auth", "config", "--configuration",
  "<jacamar.toml>"]`, `["--no-auth", "prepare"]`, `["--no-auth", "run"]`,
  `["--no-auth", "cleanup", "--configuration", "<jacamar.toml>"]`. `jacamar-auth` is
  the privileged wrapper (setuid or sudo downscoping) for a shared runner; an
  unprivileged per-user runner does not need it.
- `jacamar.toml`: `[general] executor = "slurm"`, `data_dir = <a directory the user
  owns, mode 0700 enforced>` and **`gitlab_server = "http://127.0.0.1:<port>"`**:
  Jacamar verifies the job's id token against GitLab's JWKS, fetched by default from
  the `CI_SERVER_URL` of the job response, the public endpoint, where the proxy
  answers the sign-in page (`unable to retrieve key from JWKS endpoint: failed to
  decode response, invalid character '<'`). Every job also needs the token itself,
  or `prepare_executor` fails with "No id_token found on CI_JOB_JWT variable": a
  `default: id_tokens: CI_JOB_JWT: aud: $CI_SERVER_URL` block at the top of
  `.gitlab-ci.yml` covers the project (verified: GitLab 19.5 accepts the variable as
  `aud`, Jacamar accepted the token). A job's `SCHEDULER_PARAMETERS` variable carries
  the `sbatch` options (`--nodes=1 --time=00:10:00`); `-o`, `-e`, `-J` and `--wait`
  are Jacamar's. Only `before_script` + `script` run in the batch job (`sbatch
  --wait`, output tailed from `slurm-ci-<job>.out`); sources, artifacts and
  `after_script` run on the runner's host. **Cluster-wide options** (an account, a
  partition: what an HPC site requires of every job) belong in `[batch] default_args =
  ["--account=x", ...]` of `jacamar.toml`, injected into every submission, so pipeline
  files stay portable; the form's "SLURM options for every CI job" feeds it (2026-10-29).
- **Pipelines that call `pw` need a credential that outlives the run** (pw-auth.md): the
  form takes an ACTIVATE API key on cloud clusters (hidden for `existing`,
  `managed-cluster` and the workspace, the probe pattern), carried by the top-level
  `env:` block as `GITLAB_PW_API_KEY`; `lib/start.sh` checks it with `PW_API_KEY=<key> pw
  auth whoami` (a bad key fails the run), else the host's sign-in with `env -u PW_API_KEY
  pw auth whoami`, else notes that pipelines cannot call pw; the launcher starts the
  runner with `env PW_API_KEY=<key>` or `env -u PW_API_KEY`, outside the `set -x` trace.
  The shell executor's jobs inherit the runner's environment (verified: PATH, PORT,
  `PW_PLATFORM_HOST`); the runner used to inherit the run's key as well, which dies with
  the run. Jacamar's stages do not inherit anything (next bullet).
- **Jacamar's host-side stages run as `env -i /bin/bash --login` scripts** (its docs, and
  verified 2026-10-29): the runner's environment never reaches them, and the artifact and
  cache stages look `gitlab-runner` up by name, so a runner binary outside the login
  shell's PATH gives "Missing gitlab-runner. Uploading artifacts is disabled." (the job
  still succeeds, the artifacts never arrive, a `needs:` consumer finds nothing). A
  symlink in `~/bin` (on the PATH of the default Rocky and Ubuntu profiles) fixed it;
  `user_bash_env = ["PATH=<dir>:$PATH"]` in `jacamar.toml` does not: the value goes to
  `env -i` as is, `$PATH` stays literal and the job dies with `bash: No such file or
  directory`. The launcher creates the link and probes a login shell for it.
- **Jacamar needs SLURM accounting.** After the batch job ends it reads the state
  with `sacct`; on a cluster without `AccountingStorageType` the job's script runs
  to the end and the CI job still fails with `unable to obtained output via sacct:
  Slurm accounting storage is disabled` (the lab GPU box, 2026-10-28). No option
  turns this off; the controller refuses the SLURM runner there. On gcpsmall
  (`accounting_storage/slurmdbd`) the whole path ran through the workflow (2026-10-28):
  the demo pipeline's `hello-slurm` job became SLURM job `ci-4_<id>` on a compute node
  that SLURM powered on for it, Jacamar read `COMPLETED` from `sacct`, the job succeeded;
  the pipeline took about 220 s with the node boot. A test's teardown right after the run
  completes aborts a pipeline still running (`Job failed: aborted: terminated` in
  `runner.log`), which is the test, not the runner.
