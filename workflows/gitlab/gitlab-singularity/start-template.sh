# Interactive Session Service Starter - GitLab (Singularity)
#
# Purpose: Run the single-user GitLab image as the workflow user: an
#          Apptainer/Singularity instance with no root, no fakeroot and no
#          writable layer. Every service of the Linux package runs as the
#          user, whom the container's passwd names git (and every other
#          account of the package), so the image needs no subuid range and
#          nothing it writes belongs to another id: the run directory can be
#          on any filesystem (NFS, Lustre, GPFS) and is removed with rm -rf.
#          The SIF runs as is where the node mounts it; a node that cannot
#          mount a SIF for an unprivileged user (no FUSE: hardened login
#          nodes) runs the image extracted once into the install directory.
#          Behind a pw endpoint on a pinned subdomain, with ACTIVATE as an
#          OpenID Connect provider when the form carries an OIDC client, a
#          license, the CI runners (shell on this host, SLURM through Jacamar
#          CI). What does not depend on the runtime is in lib/start.sh (this
#          script) and lib/launcher.sh (the launcher).
# Runs on: Controller node
# Called by: Workflow after controller setup
#
# Required Environment Variables:
#   - service_parent_install_dir: where containers/gitlab.sif lives
#   - the variables lib/start.sh and lib/launcher.sh list
