# GitLab controller, shared by gitlab-docker and gitlab-singularity (gitlab mode)
#
# Purpose: Check the form's values and install the CI runner tools
#          (lib/runner-tools.sh) on the login node. Each runtime's
#          controller.sh sources this file and adds what its runtime needs
#          (the Singularity one pulls the SIF; the Docker image is pulled in
#          start-template.sh on the node where the job runs, because image
#          caches are not shared between nodes).
# Runs on: Controller node
# Called by: workflows/gitlab/<runtime>/controller.sh (workflow preprocessing step)
#
# Required Environment Variables:
#   - service_rundir: holds config/, data/, logs/ and runner/
#   - service_parent_install_dir: where gitlab-runner and jacamar are installed
#   - service_root_password_file: optional; the root password the form carries
#   - runners_shell / runners_slurm: which CI runners to register
#   - runners_group: optional; the path of the group that owns the runners
#   - oidc_client_id / oidc_client_secret_file: both set, or neither (the
#     user's account variables GITLAB_CLIENT_ID and GITLAB_CLIENT_SECRET)
