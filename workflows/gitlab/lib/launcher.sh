# GitLab launcher library, shared by gitlab-docker and gitlab-singularity
#
# Purpose: Everything the script that pw endpoints run executes does that does
#          not depend on the container runtime: the public host and the lock,
#          the nginx snippet (forwarded headers, the OIDC hop page and the
#          readiness gate, the route that tells other users' runners where
#          this GitLab listens), the Linux package's configuration, the wait
#          for the sign-in page, and the setup after the boot (license, the
#          owner's group and account, the CI runners through lib/runners.sh).
#          The launcher sources it, defines gitlab_exec (run a command in the
#          container), gitlab_alive (is the container running) and gitlab_logs
#          (print the tail of its log) for its runtime, starts the container
#          and calls gitlab_wait_ready, then gitlab_setup.
# Runs on: Controller node, under pw endpoints run (PORT,
#          PW_ENDPOINT_HOST, PW_ENDPOINT_PATH, PW_ENDPOINT_URL exported)
#
# Required Environment Variables (exported by lib/start.sh):
#   - run_dir: this job's run/ directory (activate/, gitlab.env, launcher.exit)
#   - service_rundir, service_ssh_port, root_password_file, service_license_file
#   - runners_shell, runners_slurm, runners_group, runner_root,
#     gitlab_runner_bin, jacamar_bin
#   - platform_host, oidc_client_id, oidc_client_secret_file, oidc_display_name,
#     oidc_block_new_users

# The platform proxy forwards X-Forwarded-Proto: http, under which GitLab (an
# https external_url) redirects every page to itself and refuses to write its
# Secure session cookie, so the bundled nginx sets the forwarded headers
# itself. The same proxy also rewrites every redirect to another host onto
# the session's own host, which would send the browser to <this host>/api/
# oidc/authorize instead of the platform's sign-in: for the one route that
# redirects to the identity provider, nginx intercepts the 3xx and answers a
# 200 page that navigates there itself (redirects within this host are
# re-issued as they were). The directory is mounted into the config volume
# and its file included from the server block, so the host's user can rewrite
# it on every start although the volume belongs to the container.
#
# The run completes as soon as the platform's probe of /users/sign_in gets a
# 200, while the runners are registered after GitLab answers: until this
# launcher touches the ready marker that page answers 503 to everyone but
# this launcher's own probe, so a setup failure fails the run instead of
# leaving a completed run whose service the cleanup then removed.
#
# A user who adds their own runners to this GitLab (the workflow's runner
# mode) must reach it on this host's loopback, so the snippet also answers,
# behind the platform's sign-in, which port it listens on, as which uid and
# on which host: the one piece of information the proxy's routing of the
