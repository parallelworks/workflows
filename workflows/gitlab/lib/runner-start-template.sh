# GitLab runner starter (runner mode)
#
# Purpose: Add the user's own CI runners to a GitLab another user started on
#          this login node with this workflow, so that the user's pipelines
#          run as the user, with the user's cluster account and credentials,
#          and never as the GitLab's owner. The GitLab is reached on the
#          host's loopback (the platform's proxy blocks git and the runner):
#          this script asks the GitLab, through its public address with the
#          run's key, which loopback port it listens on and which uid owns it,
#          and every connection the runner makes goes through a forwarder of
#          this run that first checks, in /proc/net/tcp, that the socket at
#          the other end belongs to that uid, so a process of another user
#          that takes the port over later never sees a runner token or a
#          job's variables. The runners are registered with the user's
#          personal access token as runners of the project or group the user
#          named, so only that project's or group's pipelines run here; their
#          tokens are kept in the runner directory and found again by a later
#          start. The endpoint serves a status page of the runners.
# Runs on: Controller node
# Called by: Workflow after controller setup
#
# Required Environment Variables:
#   - pw_endpoints_args: Arguments for pw endpoints run (--name)
#   - runners_gitlab_url: the GitLab's address, https://<subdomain>.<sessions domain>
#   - runners_path: the project or group the runners belong to
#   - runners_token_file: the personal access token the form carried (may be empty)
#   - runners_rundir: holds tokens/, config.toml, builds/, cache/ and runner.log
#   - runners_shell, runners_slurm: which CI runners to start
#   - service_parent_install_dir: holds gitlab-runner/current and
#     jacamar-ci/current, installed by lib/runner-controller.sh when needed
#   - PW_API_KEY (runtime env): the run's key, to read the GitLab's loopback
#     port through its public address
