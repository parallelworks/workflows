# GitLab start template, shared by gitlab-docker and gitlab-singularity
#
# Purpose: What every runtime's start script does before its container starts:
#          defaults, the runner tools, the first half of cancel.sh (the CI
#          runner), the pinned subdomain, the root password, the exports the
#          launcher reads, and finish_endpoint_run for the status that
#          pw endpoints run returns
# Runs on: Controller node
# Called by: workflows/gitlab/<runtime>/start-template.sh (sourced)
#
# Required Environment Variables:
#   - pw_endpoints_args: Arguments for pw endpoints run (--name, ...)
#   - service_rundir: holds config/, data/, logs/, runner/ and the generated secrets
#   - service_subdomain: subdomain label of the URL (default gitlab-<PW_USER>)
#   - service_ssh_port: loopback port of GitLab's SSH
#   - service_root_password_file: optional; the root password for a first start
#   - runners_shell, runners_slurm: which CI runners to start
#   - service_parent_install_dir: holds gitlab-runner/current and
#     jacamar-ci/current, installed by controller.sh when needed
#   - oidc_client_id, oidc_display_name: optional ACTIVATE OIDC client
