"""Fleet topology graph builder.

Turns the two data sources the dashboard already collects — the fleet status
payload (one row per HPC system) and the PW cluster telemetry payload (queues,
nodes, allocations for clusters we can actually log into) — into a single
node/edge graph the topology page can draw.

The graph is three tiers:

    monitor ──▶ site (DSRC / data center) ──▶ system

A "system" node is the merge of what the site *reports* about a machine
(status, scheduler, login node) and what we *observe* by connecting to it
(cores, queues, GPUs, allocation). Either half can be missing: a DSRC system
we have no account on still shows up, and a PW cluster that isn't in the
site's status page gets its own node.

Everything here is a pure function of its inputs so it can be unit tested
without a server, a network, or a database.
