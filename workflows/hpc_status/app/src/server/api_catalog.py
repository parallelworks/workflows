"""The API's description of itself.

One list, three consumers: ``GET /api/endpoints``, the in-app API page, and
the generated OpenAPI document. Documentation that lives somewhere else
rots — the committed spec had picked up two endpoints that never existed
and lost five that did — so the catalog sits next to the handlers, and a
test fails if it and the router disagree in either direction.

# the caller fills in; the router matches those by prefix. ``returns`` lists
