# NOAA RDHPCS — Marketplace Descriptions

Short marketing copy for each cluster currently surfaced by the RDHPCS Status
Monitor. Three lengths to pick from per cluster:

1. **One-liner** — a single sentence for a chip / row / dropdown tooltip.
2. **Tagline** — a hero strapline for a card or banner.
3. **Summary + best-for** — the body text + use-case bullets for a detail
   panel or workflow listing page.

Each entry mirrors the `noaa_systems:` block in
[configs/config.noaa.yaml](../configs/config.noaa.yaml).

## Mercury

**Cross-RDHPCS data transfer hub and HPSS archive gateway.**

Dedicated data-mover system shared across the RDHPCS fleet for secure transfer
of NOAA R&D datasets to/from external collaborators. Direct `hsi` / `htar`
access to the HPSS archive. No scheduler — interactive use only.

## NOAA Cloud (v3)

**On-demand HPC bursts to AWS, GCP, and Azure via Parallel Works.**

User-provisioned cloud HPC clusters managed by the RDHPCS Cloud Platform on
Parallel Works. Pick instance types, attach Lustre and object storage, and
run the same Slurm workflows you use on-prem — pay only while the cluster is
up.
