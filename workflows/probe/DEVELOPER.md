# PROBE developer guide

## Layout

```
app/probe/__main__.py       command line: run, serve, list, fetch-tests
app/probe/definitions.py    test definition files: validation, ids (from the fields, not the path), target
app/probe/pw.py             pw CLI wrapper, git checkout of workflow YAMLs
app/probe/runner.py         one run of the suite: gate, launch, poll, verdict, cleanup, record, upload
app/probe/results.py        results tree: one record.json per execution directory, state and history
app/probe/server.py         dashboard server: static web/ plus the JSON API
app/probe/tests_source.py   fetch the test definitions directory from its git repository (probe fetch-tests)
app/web/                    index.html, app.js, styles.css (no build step, no external assets)
selftest/                   offline unit tests with a mock pw CLI, browser check
scripts/import_workflow_tests.py  converts this repository's recorded tests into definitions
yamls/general.yaml          platform workflow: the two dashboards
yamls/general_run_tests.yaml  platform workflow: run all or selected tests once
tests/<variant>/            end-to-end tests of the two YAMLs (tools/tests/run-workflow-test.py)

```

`app/` is the only subtree the workflows check out at run time, so everything the
runner and the dashboards need is below it and nothing else is. The test definitions
are not here: they live in a tests repository per platform
(`parallelworks/probe-tests-activate-parallel-works` for `activate.parallel.works`), together with the
GitHub actions that deploy these YAMLs.

No third-party Python packages. The code targets Python 3.8; cluster login nodes run
3.6 to 3.12 (gcpsmall has 3.9).

## Self-tests

```bash
cd workflows/probe
PYTHONPATH=app python3 -m unittest discover -s selftest -t .
```

No platform needed. `selftest/mockbin/pw` stands in for the CLI and follows a JSON
configuration (see its docstring); every test also gets a small local git repository
shaped like this one. Covered: definition validation, target derivation, every verdict
path (pass, skip, launch failure, run error, timeout, setup, leftovers, `--keep`),
selection by file, record and directory layout, bucket upload, the results reader
(regressions, running detection, malformed records) and the server API including path
safety and the read-only refusal of admin actions. Under two minutes.

### Browser check

`bash selftest/ui_check.sh` starts a local admin dashboard on the mock CLI with a
seeded results tree and drives every control in headless Chrome over the DevTools
protocol (`selftest/ui_check.js`): filters, search, theme, matrix chips, the drawer and
its tabs, artifact files, Refresh (bucket pull), Rerun test, Cancel run, Run all with
its second-click confirmation, and the refusal of an overlapping run. Needs Chrome and
Node 22 or newer. Destructive buttons ask for a second click instead of
`window.confirm`, which the platform blocks inside its session frame.

## One test execution

`runner.TestRun.execute`, in order:

1. Resource gate: `pw cluster ls -o json` (or `pw kube ls`), fetched once per suite run.
   Off or unlisted: a `<start>_skip` directory with the record and the log.
2. Execution directory `<start>_pending`, renamed to `<start>_<slug>` after the launch
   or `<start>_launch-failed`.
3. Workflow YAML: one shallow `git fetch --depth 1` per `(repo, ref)` per suite run, the
   YAML materialised with sparse checkout. Its HEAD is `workflow.commit`.
4. Under a lock per `(resource, workflow_name)`, so two tests of one workflow never
   install into the same directory at once: `warm_marker` check, `setup` snippet and
   process snapshot over `pw ssh`, then `pw workflows run --trust <local yaml> -i
   <inputs> --name "probe: <id>" -o json`, retried on transient errors. A failing setup
   fails the test at `launch`.
5. Poll `pw workflows runs view -o json` every 15 s until a final status, the timeout
   (then `pw workflows runs cancel`) or an interrupt.
6. Verdict: `completed` passes; anything else fails at `run` with the first error
   annotation of `pw workflows runs errors`. The workflow, not PROBE, checks that its
   service is healthy before it completes. This is why only workflows that run to
   completion are supported and the older session pattern (a `sessions:` block, a run
   that stays alive) is not.
7. Teardown: every endpoint named `*-<slug>` is deleted and waited for, then the
   `leftover_patterns` and `leftover_commands` checks run over `pw ssh`, retried for two
   minutes. A run that registered no endpoint has nothing to delete; every test is
   treated the same.
8. `record.json` is written into the execution directory (atomically), then the
   directory is uploaded to the bucket (`--bucket`). Each execution has its own
   directory, so uploads never overwrite another runner's results. A failed upload is
   reported and makes the runner exit 2.

The record is written on every path, including internal errors.

### Why a local copy of the YAML

The platform gives every inline run of one repository
(`pw workflows run <repo>/<path>@<ref>`) the same slug (`gh-parallelworks-workflows`,
then `-2`, `-3`), and two launches at the same moment fail with `Slug ... is already in
use`. A suite launches many tests of the same repository at once, so PROBE fetches the
repository at the ref and launches the YAML as a local file, which gets a slug of its
own. The YAML's own `parallelworks/checkout` and `uses:` references are untouched, so
the run is the same one, and the checkout's HEAD is the exact commit for the record.

### Concurrency

Tests run in a thread pool (`--workers`, default 8). Launches of the same workflow on
the same resource are serialised; everything else runs in parallel. `SIGINT` and
`SIGTERM` stop the suite: polling loops cancel their runs and record them as failed;
queued tests are not started.

## Results and the dashboard

`results.py` owns the conventions: execution directory `<start time without
colons>_<run slug>` (or `_skip`, `_launch-failed`) holding `record.json`, and the last
`HISTORY_LENGTH` records in the state. A test shows as running when an execution
directory has no `record.json` yet and its `run.log` changed in the last two hours.

`server.py` serves `web/` and this API, recognised by the `/api/` segment wherever the
endpoint prefix puts it:

| Route | Returns |
|---|---|
| `GET api/state` | every test (from records and definitions) with status, change, history, target; suite runs; definition errors |
| `GET api/tests/<id>/records` | all records of a test, oldest first |
| `GET api/tests/<id>/definition` | the definition file |
| `GET api/tests/<id>/artifacts` | execution directories and their files |
| `GET api/tests/<id>/artifacts/<dir>/<file>` | a file (last 4 MB) |
| `POST api/refresh` | re-fetches the test definitions from their repository (when the server was given one), then downloads the bucket into a staging directory and swaps it in as the local results copy, or merges it while a run started from this dashboard is in progress (both dashboards) |
| `POST api/delete` `{"id"}` | admin: removes every result of a test that has no definition, from the bucket and then locally; 400 with a definition, 409 while an execution is in progress |
| `POST api/run` `{"ids": [...]}` or `{"all": true}` | admin: starts `python3 -m probe run --bucket ...` in the background; 409 while an overlapping run is in progress |
| `POST api/cancel` `{"slug", "platform"}` | admin: `pw workflows runs cancel` |

Ids and file names are validated against `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` segments and resolved inside
the results directory. Without `--admin` every POST except `api/refresh` answers 403.
The runner the admin dashboard starts runs with `app/` as its working directory, which
is how it finds the `probe` package.

The dashboard is served at `/` behind a subdomain endpoint or under
`/me/session/<user>/<name>/` behind a path-based one. `index.html` builds a `<base>`
from its own location; the server takes the prefix from `--prefix` (`pw endpoints run`
passes `{path}`), `PW_ENDPOINT_PATH` or `X-Forwarded-Prefix`.

## The workflows

`yamls/general.yaml` follows the endpoint pattern of the other workflows here. `setup`
checks out `workflows/probe/app` from this repository and fetches the test definitions
(`python3 -m probe fetch-tests`, which both workflows and the dashboard's Refresh use),
restores the results from the bucket (a bucket path with no objects yet is fine; any
other failure stops the run) and writes one start script per dashboard into
`dashboard/` and `admin/`; each script puts `app/` on `PYTHONPATH` and runs
`pw endpoints run --name probe[-admin]-${PW_RUN_SLUG} -- python3 -m probe serve ...
--bucket <bucket>/<path>`. For each dashboard a runner job submits the script through
the `script_submitter` subworkflow and a wait job calls the `wait_for_endpoint`
subworkflow, which waits until the endpoint is listed and its URL answers, touches the
skip-cleanups file and cancels the runner job. The run then completes while the servers
keep running; a runner that exits before its endpoint came online fails the run. Runs
started from the admin dashboard inherit the bucket. `pw endpoints delete` tears a
dashboard down.

A CLI run (`pw workflows run -i`) leaves an omitted input empty or `undefined` instead
of applying the form's default, so every `run:` step applies the defaults of the
`tests` and `results` inputs itself.

**Credentials.** Every step of a run has `PW_API_KEY`, the run's token, and that token
is rejected as soon as the run completes (verified by testing a stored run token before
and after completion). The node's own `pw` has no user context, and secret user
variables are not readable from a run. The dashboards outlive their run, so
`general.yaml` takes an API key as a `password` input and carries it in its top-level
`env` block as `PROBE_API_KEY`, which reaches every step, including the script that
`script_submitter` launches (`PW_API_KEY` itself cannot be overridden: the platform
injects the run's token). Each start script exports it as `PW_API_KEY`, so the key lives
in the environment of `pw endpoints run`, `probe serve` and the runners it spawns, and
nowhere on disk.

Like every other input, the platform keeps it in the run's record (`pw workflows runs
view -o json` shows it in `inputs`, in plain text as of September 2026) and renders it
into the step's script under the job's `logs/` directory on the resource; deleting the
job directory removes that copy. The equivalent without an input is a credentials
directory on the resource authenticated once with `pw auth` and selected with
`PW_CREDENTIALS_DIR`, which the CLI honours the same way. `general_run_tests.yaml`
needs no key: its runner works while its run is alive.

`yamls/general_run_tests.yaml` has one job: checkout, fetch the test definitions, then
`python3 -m probe run --bucket <bucket>/<path> --all` or `--test <file>` per line of the
`selection` input. The step's exit code is the runner's, so a failing test ends the run
in error, which the GitHub action reports.

The GitHub actions live in the tests repository: they install the `pw` CLI on the
runner, authenticate with the platform's repository secret through `PW_API_KEY`, write
`inputs.json`, check out this repository at a chosen ref and `pw workflows run --trust`
the YAML from it. The dashboard action passes the same secret as the dashboards' API
key. Both are manual (`workflow_dispatch`); a `schedule` trigger on the test action
would run the suite periodically.

Validate a change with `pw workflows run --trust --dry-run -i inputs.json
/abs/path/workflows/probe/yamls/<file>.yaml`. The YAML is read locally, but `app/` is
fetched from GitHub at run time: push the branch and point both YAMLs' checkout
`branch:` at it while developing, and restore `canary` before the change merges.

## End-to-end tests of PROBE itself

`tests/general/gcpsmall.json` starts the dashboards on `pw://alvaro/gcpsmall` and
`tests/general_run_tests/gcpsmall.json` runs one PROBE test (the `script_submitter`
canary) through `general_run_tests.yaml`; both read and write the production results
bucket. The dashboards test takes its API key from the environment at launch
(`_test.secrets`: `PROBE_API_KEY`), so the key is never in the test file:

```bash
PROBE_API_KEY=<key> python3 tools/tests/run-workflow-test.py workflows/probe/tests/general/gcpsmall.json
python3 tools/tests/run-workflow-test.py workflows/probe/tests/general_run_tests/gcpsmall.json
```

## Adding test definitions

In the tests repository: copy a file, give it a new `name`, change the target and
inputs, and check it with `python3 -m probe list --tests <dir>`, which also notes files
that are not at `<platform>/<user>/<workflow_name>/<name>.json`. The inputs are the form
payload of the workflow. The recorded tests under `workflows/<name>/tests/<variant>/`
here convert with `scripts/import_workflow_tests.py` (their `_test` object maps to
`timeout_s`, `warm_marker`, `leftover_patterns`, `leftover_commands` and `setup`; tests
with other `_test` keys are reported and skipped). Keep `timeout_s` above the
cold-install time of the workflow on that system. A `script_submitter` test needs
`define_cleanup_script: false` in its inputs or the platform rejects the launch.
