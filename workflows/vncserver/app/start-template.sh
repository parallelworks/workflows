#!/bin/bash
# start-template.sh - host desktop through a pw endpoint (runs on the compute node)
#
# Serves the compute image's own KasmVNC desktop (system kasmvncserver +
# GNOME). Xvnc serves the web client and the websocket itself over HTTPS
# (the packaged vncserver wrapper uses the system TLS certificate, which the
# users group can read), so the endpoint client is `pw endpoints https` and
# no reverse proxy, noVNC download, or container is needed.
#
# From inputs.sh:
#   - endpoint_name / endpoint_slug: pw endpoints registration
#   - pw_endpoints_args: --no-subdomain (emed has no session subdomains) and
#     --strip-path (Xvnc serves at the root; the platform forwards the full
#     /me/session/<user>/<name>/ prefix, and the slug's host= parameter makes
#     the viewer open its websocket under that prefix)
#   - password: vestigial (web basic auth is disabled; the endpoint already
#     requires platform login), but the viewer accepts it in the URL
#   - service_desktop: -select-de value for the vncserver wrapper (gnome)
#   - service_load_env / service_bin (app variants): command that puts the app
#     on the PATH (module load ...) and the binary to run on the desktop
